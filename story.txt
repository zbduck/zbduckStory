She jumped at hearing Kevin’s voice.  She looked into those blue eyes and couldn’t help the stupid grin that spring to her face.  “Depends.  Do you want us to call in?” she said.

Once they were both ready, they began walking outside to go get breakfast. As they were walking down the sidewalk the ground started to rumble.
Then from out of nowhere, a giant drill emerged from the ground, it was none other than THE UNDERMINER from The Incredibles

They begin to run. The ground still shakes around them, setting of car alarms and shattering windows. Neither of them know to do and they are fearful. Just when they think there is no hope for them, they see the siloutte of all 4 Incredibles against the sun at the top of the street.

At that moment, she wake up. "What a terrible dream!" she thought.
